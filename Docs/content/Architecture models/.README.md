All diagram files in this directory are images which can be edited with 
[draw.io](https://www.drawio.com), as marked with the `*.drawio.png` extension.

The images contain a copy of the diagram structure as metadata. This allow the 
diagram to be viewed as an image (makes it handy to view in GitHub or to display 
on websites) while also remaining editable.

[Download and install](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases) the 
latest release of draw.io to open the image files for editing.

Make edits in draw.io, save the files and commit them to publish them.
