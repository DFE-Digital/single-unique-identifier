# Overview

Architectural decisions in the single unique identifier (SUI) programme are 
captured using architecture decision records (ADRs).

Since many decisions will need to be recorded over multiple components, the 
ADRs are structured into two categories:

- **System**: Decisions on how the system is structured as a whole.

- **Component**: Decisions how particular components are structured.
